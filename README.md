## Synopsis and Motivation
TiltQuiz is an Android-based quiz game that completely revolutionizes how we interact with our smart devices. 
The design concept is to allow users to answer the questions with minimum response time. In order to do that, 
each question is placed in the center of the screen, and choices are placed around the four edges. The user 
makes the choice by tilting their device toward the direction of their desired choice. In that way, the user 
can spend their time answering question, rather than spend time carefully picking the choice.
